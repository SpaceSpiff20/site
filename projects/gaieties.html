                    <strong>Detailed Overview:</strong><br>
                    As director of Stanford Gaieties, a student-written musical tradition dating back to 1911 and
                    performed the week before Big Game,I led a 25+ person cast through an intensive fall rehearsal
                    process to bring an original script to life.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    My directing approach balances a clear, script-faithful vision with generous room for actors to
                    explore, play, and surprise me. We began with a full table read and ensemble-building work, then
                    used improv exercises to strengthen presence and connection in scenes. I’m a firm believer that deep
                    attention to scene partners, paired with a precise understanding of each character’s wants and
                    goals, creates the most compelling (and funniest) stage work.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Behind the scenes, I worked closely with my assistant director and stage manager to design rehearsal
                    schedules around complex student availability and evolving material (a natural challenge in an
                    entirely original production). I came into rehearsals with detailed blocking plans and diagrams,
                    then refined them collaboratively. I also mentored performers throughout the process, including
                    first-time actors in leading roles, using character work grounded in Uta Hagen–influenced acting
                    pedagogy. (Yes, this included spending rehearsals studying bear physicality for our Oski the Bear.)
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    During tech, I partnered with lighting and sound to walk scene-by-scene through cues and
                    transitions, aligning design choices with the story we were telling. When inevitable obstacles came
                    up, like sudden space issues or incomplete orchestration, I relied on an improv mindset I value
                    deeply: strong hits, lightly held. I show up with a plan, then adapt quickly and calmly when
                    circumstances change.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The production was a major success, selling ~4,000 tickets, outperforming the previous year by ~2%,
                    and selling out on closing night. What I’m proudest of, though, is the community the process built:
                    several cast members immediately pursued future leadership roles (assistant producing, choreography,
                    vocal direction). Ultimately, directing Gaieties affirmed something central for me, I feel most
                    fulfilled when I get to be a conduit for other people’s creativity.

                    <strong>Responsibilities:</strong><br>
                    As the director I held many responsibilites. Being the director, I was responsible for helping hold
                    auditions, casting the show, rehearsing the
                    cast, and overseeing the production of the show. Auditions started the first week of school and
                    rehearsals began the following week. In order to ensure we had enough rehearsal time, we would
                    rehearse up to a minimum of 20 hours a week.-->
